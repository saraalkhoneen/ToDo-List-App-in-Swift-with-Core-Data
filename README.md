# swifty to do list

ToDo List App in Swift using Core Data

This Swift project is a simple To-Do List app that allows users to add and remove tasks. The app uses the Core Data framework for data persistence, storing tasks in a local database. The main features include:

Task List Display: The main screen displays a list of tasks in a table view.
Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the list by tapping the "+" button.
Remove Task: Tasks can be removed by tapping on them in the list.
Core Data Integration: The app utilizes Core Data for storing and retrieving tasks.
User Interface: The user interface is built using UIKit components, including a navigation controller, table view, and bar button items.
This project serves as a foundation for building more complex iOS applications with features like task prioritization, due dates, and additional user interactions. The Core Data integration ensures that tasks persist between app launches, providing a seamless user experience. Developers can extend this project by incorporating further functionality and refining the user interface based on their specific requirements.
